    <p><strong>Jean-Baptiste Labat</strong> (1663–1738) was a French Dominican missionary, writer, explorer, and ethnographer. He is best known for his detailed accounts of life in the Caribbean during the late 17th and early 18th centuries.</p>

    <h2>Early Life and Career</h2>
    <p>Labat was born in Paris in 1663. He joined the Dominican Order in 1685 and was ordained as a priest in 1689. In 1693, he volunteered to go to the Caribbean as a missionary.</p>

    <h2>Caribbean Experience</h2>
    <p>Labat arrived in Martinique in 1694 and spent the next two decades living and working in various parts of the Caribbean, including Guadeloupe and Saint-Domingue (now Haiti). During this time, he served not only as a priest but also as a planter, engineer, and military leader.</p>

    <h2>Writings and Legacy</h2>
    <p>Upon his return to France in 1705, Labat began writing about his experiences in the Caribbean. His most famous work, "Nouveau Voyage aux isles Françoises de l'Amérique" (New Voyage to the French Islands of America), was published in 1722. This six-volume work provided detailed descriptions of Caribbean flora, fauna, and indigenous peoples, as well as accounts of colonial life and the slave trade.</p>

    <p>Labat's writings are considered valuable historical sources, offering insights into Caribbean society, economy, and natural history during the colonial period. However, his work has also been criticized for its Eurocentric perspective and its acceptance of slavery as a normal part of colonial life.</p>

    <h2>Later Life</h2>
    <p>Labat spent his later years in Italy and France, continuing to write and publish. He died in Paris in 1738 at the age of 74 or 75.</p>
